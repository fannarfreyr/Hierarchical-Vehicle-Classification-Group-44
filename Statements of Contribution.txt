Fannar Freyr Jónuson:
In terms of model implementation, I developed the most of the code for the model setup, training loop, and the model evaluation. I performed most of the training experiments: baseline (frozen), fine-tuned (unfrozen), 2-head, 2-head + Data Augmentation, 2-head + DA + Class Balancing, 3-head, 3-head + curriculum learning, 2-head + curriculum learning, 3-head + HLS, 3-head + LRS.
For the project report, I was responsible for revising, and discussing possible changes to be made to text the others wrote.


Jendrik Engels:
In terms of model implementation, I developed multiple variants of Test-Time Augmentation (TTA). 
For the project report, I was responsible for writing multiple sections, including the Introduction, Related Work, Qualitative Evaluation, and Discussion. 
I conducted part of the literature research, finding the most relevant findings to support these sections.
Additionally, I designed graphics to visually represent the model architecture, featuring three fully connected output heads. 
I also created visualizations for the Qualitative Evaluation, showcasing misclassified car samples, their Top-5 predictions, and the corresponding heatmaps.


András Szabolcs Gyüre:

I made the logging system (see experiment_logging.py) which made logs into experiment_log.md, 
made the visualizations for plots, confusion matrix, save our model, load the saved model, I implemented the third-Head which was the Type-Head,
and made the Notebook more readable, with the Markdowns.
I also wrote like the half of the riport (eg. Abstract, Conclusion, Methods, Results , except qualitative evaulation.
